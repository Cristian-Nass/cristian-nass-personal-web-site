    description: `
        I work primarily as a Front-end developer, but I also assist with Back-end tasks 
        using Node.js.
        I'm proud to be part of a talented team that has successfully created and 
        implemented various applications for a wide range of clients, including Uppsala 
        Kummon, OKQ8, Preem, Circle-K, ST1, Svenska kyrka, Stuns Life, Fixi, and many 
        others.
        Our front-end work is mainly focused on React, although we have also undertaken 
        a Vue.js project in the past. 
        On the back-end side, I've gained experience working with Node.js and Firebase.
        For state management, we utilize various libraries and packages such as Redux 
        Toolkit, MobX, Zustand, and useContext. 
        In terms of design and UI components, I'm proficient in working with Ant Design, 
        Material UI, Style Components, Recharts, and more.
        In addition to these technologies, I have experience with Firebase, FireStore, 
        Google Cloud Functions, Sendgrid, and other tools and services essential for 
        creating robust and efficient web applications
